        **GameOn Live Fantasy API**

        Here is the API related to the Live Fantasy game.

        **Brief description of the set of features:**

        - **Account Creation:** Users have two types of accounts, guest account (created when the app is downloaded) and full account (when users sign up with Google and Apple). Full account users have a Sequence Wallet generated.
        - **Player Selection:** Users using any account type may select 4 players to enter a match.
        - **Power Ups / Boosts:** There is a set of consumables that users can spend credits to utilize and boost their points during a match.
        - **Credits:** It's the soft currency that users can earn through play or purchase through microtransactions.
        - **Payments / In-App Purchase:** It's the in-app purchase flow where users can purchase credits or avatar packs.
        - **Avatar Packs:** Are the consumable items that users can buy that contain multiple Player Avatars.
        - **Player Avatars:** Are premium versions of an Athlete that, during player selection, if a user selects a player whose avatar they own, they will earn a multiplier in their points.
        - **Inventory:** It's the location where users can view their unopened Avatar Packs, open their Avatar Packs, and view their Player Avatars.
        - **Match:** Is the live game with data provided by a third-party Data Provider. Users join Matches by selecting four players.
        - **Leaderboards:** By selecting Players to join a Match, users are added to leaderboard rankings for that Match.
        - **Chat:** In the chat window of each match, users can communicate with each other by text.
        - **Divisions:** By scoring and being part of leaderboards, the top 5 results of a User's participation on that game week are added to a global leaderboard. At the end of each game week, users are promoted/relegated/considered safe to the next/previous division. Users will also earn rewards at the end of each game week, dependent on their division ranking.
        - **Game Week:** is what GameOn considers as a grouping of matches, currently set on a Monday to Monday schedule.

        **1. Authentication: The Gatekeeper**
        - **Role and Interaction:**
          - **Purpose:** Authentication is the foundational layer that secures the API, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive information and perform actions. It primarily uses JWT (JSON Web Token) for securing endpoints.
          - **Internal Interaction:** When a user sends a request to an endpoint that requires authentication, the JWT middleware checks if the token is valid and corresponds to an active session. If the token is valid, the request proceeds; otherwise, the user is prompted to authenticate.
          - **Endpoints Interaction:**
            - **Games and Matches:** Users need to authenticate to join games, view detailed match information, participate in match-specific chats, and access leaderboards.
            - **Web3 Interactions:** Authentication is required to manage NFTs, open card packs, and view digital assets securely.
            - **Chats:** Both general and match-specific chats require the user to be authenticated to ensure that only registered users can send and receive messages.
            - **Purchases and IAP:** Secure access is needed for making purchases, accessing transaction history, and interacting with RevenueCat services.

        **2. Games and Matches: The Core Experience**
